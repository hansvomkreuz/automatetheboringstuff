"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for the Total Beginner" is a book written by Al Sweigart. [1, 2]  Available resources include online version of the book and an online course at Udemy following this book's content can be taken.  Below is my attempt to follow the tutorials in the book while also taking the online course. This is my attempt at learning Python from scratch and at the same time my first attempt at using JupyterLab.
